# Node Data Processing Assignment
Please find my submission of the assignment. 
The CSV file will need to be saved in the folder "csv"
The 3 .json files will be output in the results folder
I have combined the output for task 2 and 3 as it was indicated that extra data could be added to the output, therefor task2.json and task3.json are actually just duplicates for formalities

### Project Commands
- `npm install` - will setup and install all packages if fresh copy downloaded from Git
- `npm start` - Executes program
- `npm run dev` - will run in a nodemon (bug - runs continously as it sees a change of the saved .json files and re-runs)
